== Usage Personas

People and organisations in Australia perform different roles with respect to address information. This section of this standard lists known _personas_ - these people and organisation roles - and the next section lists common tasks that people and organisations with those roles play. Section X then describes how those tasks can be carried out to meet the requirements given in Annex A.
